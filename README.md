# MahJong_Scores_.._..

## Purpose

MahJong_Scores.swift is an IOS application to keep scores of one or more MahJong tournaments.
This project uses CloudKit to sync owner's devices.

A MahJong tournament consists of all four players being the wind players for all 4 winds. Thus in total at least 16 games, but usually more. 

Completion of a tournament can take days, weeks or even much longer. That's why I developed this little app.

## Usage

Create a tournament by tapping the "+". Select the newly created tournament. All players should have 2000 points. Press "Game completed" and, if necessary, rotate the players and enter the computed scores.

## Notes

The "computed scores" are the game results for each player.

## To do

1. Is it useful to keep an overall average player score across tournaments?
2. Develop an easy way to enter the stones for all 4 players at the end of the game and compute the score?
3. Strategy tutorial?
4. Both for traditional and American tournaments?
5. Enter American scoring cards?
